## Scope

The Music Database includes all entities necessary to facilitate the process of managing music data and providing features for users to explore and enjoy music. As such, included in the database's scope is:

* Artists, including basic identifying information
* Albums, including information about albums released by artists
* Songs, representing individual songs within albums
* Genres, categorizing songs based on musical genres
* Playlists, allowing users to create and manage playlists of their favorite songs

Out of scope are elements like music streaming capabilities, user authentication, and complex recommendation algorithms.

## Functional Requirements

This database will support:

* CRUD operations for artists, albums, songs, genres, and playlists
* Tracking songs within albums and associating them with artists
* Categorizing songs into genres for easy classification
* Allowing users to create, update, and delete playlists with songs

Note that in this iteration, the system will not support features like user authentication or personalized recommendations.

## Representation

Entities are captured in SQLite tables with the following schema.

### Entities

The database includes the following entities:

#### Artists

The 'artists' table includes:

* 'artist_id', which specifies the unique ID for the artist as an 'INTEGER'. This column thus has the 'PRIMARY KEY' constraint applied.
* 'name', which specifies the artist's name as 'TEXT'.

All columns in the 'artists' table are required and hence should have the 'NOT NULL' constraint applied.

#### Albums

The 'albums' table includes:

* 'album_id', which specifies the unique ID for the album as an 'INTEGER'. This column thus has the 'PRIMARY KEY' constraint applied.
* 'title', which specifies the title of the album as 'TEXT'.
* 'artist_id', which specifies the ID of the artist who released the album as an 'INTEGER'. This column thus has the 'FOREIGN KEY' constraint applied, referencing the 'artist_id' column in the 'artists' table to ensure data integrity.
* 'release_date', which specifies the release date of the album as 'TEXT'.

All columns are required and hence have the 'NOT NULL' constraint applied where a 'PRIMARY KEY' or 'FOREIGN KEY' constraint is not. No other constraints are necessary.

#### Songs

The 'songs' table includes:

* 'song_id', which specifies the unique ID for the song as an 'INTEGER'. This column thus has the 'PRIMARY KEY' constraint applied.
* 'title', which specifies the title of the song as 'TEXT'.
* 'album_id', which specifies the ID of the album to which the song belongs as an 'INTEGER'. This column thus has the 'FOREIGN KEY' constraint applied, referencing the 'album_id' column in the 'albums' table to ensure data integrity.
* 'genre', which specifies the genre of the song as 'TEXT'.
* 'duration', which specifies the duration of the song in seconds as an 'INTEGER'.

All columns are required and hence have the 'NOT NULL' constraint applied where a 'PRIMARY KEY' or 'FOREIGN KEY' constraint is not.

#### Genres

The 'genres' table includes:

* 'genre_id', which specifies the unique ID for the genre as an 'INTEGER'. This column thus has the 'PRIMARY KEY' constraint applied.
* 'name', which specifies the name of the genre as 'TEXT'.

All columns in the 'genres' table are required and hence should have the 'NOT NULL' constraint applied.

#### Playlists

The 'playlists' table includes:

* 'playlist_id', which specifies the unique ID for the playlist as an 'INTEGER'. This column thus has the 'PRIMARY KEY' constraint applied.
* 'name', which specifies the name of the playlist as 'TEXT'.

All columns in the 'playlists' table are required and hence should have the 'NOT NULL' constraint applied.

### Relationships

The below entity relationship diagram describes the relationships among the entities in the database.

As detailed by the diagram:

* One artist can release 0 to many albums. 0 if they have yet to release any albums, and many if they release multiple albums.
* An album can contain 0 to many songs. 0 if it's an empty album, and many if it contains multiple songs.
* A song belongs to one and only one album. At the same time, an album can contain 0 to many songs: 0 if it's an empty album, and many if it contains multiple songs.
* A song belongs to one and only one genre. Similarly, a genre can contain 0 to many songs: 0 if it doesn't have any associated songs, and many if it contains multiple songs.
* A playlist can contain 0 to many songs. 0 if it's an empty playlist, and many if it contains multiple songs. Similarly, a song can belong to 0 to many playlists: 0 if it's not included in any playlists, and many if it's included in multiple playlists.

## Optimizations

Per the typical queries in 'queries.sql', it is common for users of the database to access all songs by a particular artist. For that reason, an index is created on the 'artist_id' column in the 'albums' table to speed the identification of albums by artist.

Similarly, it is common practice for a user of the database to concerned with viewing all songs of a particular genre. As such, an index is created on the 'name' column in the 'genres' table to speed the identification of genres by name.

## Limitations

The current schema assumes a one-to-many relationship between artists and albums, albums and songs, songs and genres, and playlists and songs. Collaborative features like shared playlists would require a shift to a many-to-many relationship between playlists and songs.
